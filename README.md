<!-- Summary -->
Comic collector is designed as a way to digitally keep track of comic book collections. After creating an account and signing in users can add comic books they own to their collection list. Additionally users can add comic book to their wishlist if they don't own them so they know what titles they want to purchase. When adding a comic to either list the user will supply a title, author, issue number, and description as well as indidcate if they have read that comic. All this information is then displayed back to the user. Both lists have search and sort functionality. The sort funtionality sorts the list of comics alphabetically by either title or author. The search field takes user input and searches for comics whose titles matches the given input. All comics have two buttons, one to delete the comic and one to toggle whether the user has read it.
